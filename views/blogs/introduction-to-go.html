                                            As in modern era of rapid development, developers have to make an
                                            uncomfortable choice
                                            between rapid development and high performance while choosing a language
                                            for their projects.
                                            Languages like C and C++ offer fast execution, whereas languages like
                                            Python and Ruby offers rapid development.
                                            But the Go team went beyond to solve this problem of developers
                                            and offers a <b>high-performance language with features that make
                                            development fast.</b>

                                        </p>

                                            Go is known not only by what it includes, but also by what it doesn’t
                                            include.
                                            Go has a very <b>concise syntax</b>, and a <b>compiler that’s very
                                            fast</b>,
                                            even sometimes you’ll forget it’s running. You'll wait very less
                                            time for your project to build. </p>
                                        <p>By using Go’s <b>built-in
                                            concurrency</b> features,
                                            you can scale your software to use the resources available without using
                                            any
                                            special threading libraries. </p>
                                        <p>Go has a simple and effective <b>type
                                            system</b> that takes much of
                                            the overhead out of object-oriented development and lets you focus on
                                            <b>code reuse.</b>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Go also has a <b>garbage collector</b>, so you don’t have
                                            to worry much
                                            about memory. Let’s
                                            look quickly at some of these key features.

                                            Go compiles by using a
                                            <b>smart compiler</b> and a very <b>simplified dependency resolution
                                            algorithm.</b>
                                            While building a Go program, the go compiler only needs to look at the
                                            libraries that you
                                            include directly, rather than traversing the dependencies of all the
                                            libraries which are included in the
                                            entire dependency chain like C, C++ and Java.
                                            Even many Go applications <b>compiles in few seconds</b> in modern
                                            hardware.
                                        </p>

                                            Go’s concurrency support is one of its strongest features.
                                            A a programmer one of the most difficult thing is to write an
                                            application that
                                            effectively uses the available resources of the hardware currently
                                            running it.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Modern computers have many cores, but most programming
                                            languages don’t
                                            have any effective tools that
                                            utilizes these resources effectively. It often requires lot of thread
                                            synchronization
                                            code, which is prone to errors.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>But <b>Go's goroutines are functions that can run
                                            concurrently with

                                            entry point of your program. In Go you can execute many goroutines

                                            single thread.
                                            If you want to execute some code concurrently while you are doing

                                            development but
                                            without worrying about traditional approach</b> like abstract classes
                                            and all that
                                            we see in other programming languages.
                                            Go uses <b>composition design pattern</b> to simply embed types to reuse
                                            functionality.

                                            Go has both <b>built-in types</b> and <b>user-defined types.</b> Built
                                            in types like int and stringa, And a
                                            typical <b>user-defined type in Go will look similar to structs in C</b>
                                            and operates similarly.
                                            But Go's types can also declare methods that operate on that data.

                                            Go has a <b>modern garbage collector</b> that does the
                                            hard work for you, so that you don't have to worry about memory related
                                            things
                                            that you needs to do in C and C++. Althogh Go's garbage collection adds
                                            little
                                            overhead to program execution time but simultaneously reduces the
                                            development efforts.
                                        </p><br/>
                                        <p>
                                            Apart from all, Go has also others feautes like <b>strong tooling
                                            machanism</b> which reduces
                                            development time.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            To run a Go application, you have to <b>just build and run the
                                            binary</b> and it's all done. Nothing
                                            like jar, war and all kind of stuff.
